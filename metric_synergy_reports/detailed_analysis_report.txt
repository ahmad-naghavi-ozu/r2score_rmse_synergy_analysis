KEY INSIGHTS: Can Low RMSE Coexist with Low/Negative R²?
====================================================================================================

1. MATHEMATICAL RELATIONSHIP:
   - RMSE measures absolute prediction error (scale-dependent)
   - R² measures explained variance (scale-independent)
   - R² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot) where SS_tot = variance of y_true

2. CRITICAL FINDING: YES, Low RMSE can have Low R²!
   Condition: When ground truth has LOW VARIANCE

3. EXAMPLES FROM SCENARIOS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ✓ High Variance Data (Perfect Prediction):
     - Ground truth variance: 850.17
     - RMSE: 0.000 (low)
     - R²: 1.000 (high)
     → Low RMSE + High R² ✓

   ⚠ Low Variance Data (Low Variance Data (std=1.0)):
     - Ground truth variance: 1.16
     - RMSE: 0.443 (low)
     - R²: 0.831 (low!)
     → Low RMSE + Low R² ⚠ POSSIBLE!

4. WHY THIS HAPPENS:
   - RMSE of 2.0 on data ranging 0-100 → excellent (2% error)
   - RMSE of 2.0 on data ranging 50-52 → poor (100% of variance)
   - R² accounts for this by normalizing against variance

5. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:
   - Always report BOTH metrics
   - Low RMSE alone doesn't guarantee good model
   - If R² is low despite low RMSE → model may not capture variance
   - Check ground truth variance when interpreting metrics

6. EXTREME CASE - Negative R²:
   ⚠ Near-Mean Pred. (Low Var): R²=-0.086, RMSE=2.206
     → Model performs WORSE than simply predicting the mean!
   ⚠ Near-Min Pred. (Low Var): R²=-3.049, RMSE=0.641
     → Model performs WORSE than simply predicting the mean!
   ⚠ Inverse Relationship: R²=-2.922, RMSE=57.741
     → Model performs WORSE than simply predicting the mean!
   ⚠ Random Predictions: R²=-1.163, RMSE=42.880
     → Model performs WORSE than simply predicting the mean!
